## Downloads
Note: This mod is based on the dev build, so you run it the same way as you would the developmental version of the base game.

Download the zip from the green button at the top of the page called "Code".
Then run the game from either pure Python or a python IDE like Thonny or PyCharm - an IDE is recommended if you are unfamiliar with the command line/terminal.
Be sure to download the 64-bit version of the IDE or the game won't start.
https://thonny.org/
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

All you need to do is have your IDE downloaded and make sure all .py files of the game are opened through it. Afterward, you should be able to start the game.
